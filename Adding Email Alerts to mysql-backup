Update your mysql_backup.sh with this email function:

bash
#!/bin/bash
# ... (previous code remains)

send_email() {
    local subject=$1
    local body=$2
    echo "$body" | mailx -s "$subject" "$EMAIL_TO"
}

# After backup verification
if [ -f "$BACKUP_FILE" ]; then
    echo "Backup successful: $BACKUP_FILE"
    send_email "MySQL Backup Success" "Backup completed successfully at $(date)"
else
    echo "Backup failed!" >&2
    send_email "MySQL Backup FAILED" "Backup failed on $(date). Check logs immediately."
    exit 1
fi
